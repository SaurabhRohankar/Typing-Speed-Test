# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple typing speed test program that allows you to practice your typing skills and measure your typing speed. The program displays a random piece of text, which you must type as quickly and accurately as possible. Your typing speed in words per minute (WPM) is calculated and displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Prerequisites

This program requires Python 3 and the `curses` library, which is built into most Unix-based systems (including macOS and Linux). If you are running Windows, you may need to install a third-party library such as `windows-curses`.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply run the following command in your terminal:

Copy code

`python typing_speed_test.py`

The program will display a welcome screen, and then prompt you to begin typing. Type the displayed text as quickly and accurately as possible, and then press any key to begin a new test.
